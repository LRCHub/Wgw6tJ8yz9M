Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til
you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie,
honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get
enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie,
honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Tell your mom, girl,
and I won't stop
it until you're mine, girl
And you can't stop
that until your mine, girl
And I can't find out
what you want, what you got
I got that honey-pie,
come bite it
Bring your own fork,
girl, you know
I don't provide it
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til
you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie,
honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til
you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie,
honey, honey, honey-pie
Oh, honey, honey-pie,
honey, honey, honey-pie
Oh, honey, honey-pie,
honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Tell your mom, girl,
and I won't stop it
until you're mine, girl
And you can't stop
that until your mine, girl
And I can't find out
what you want
Tell your mom, girl,
and I won't stop
it until you're mine, girl
And you can't stop
that until your mine, girl
(Ha!)
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til
you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie,
honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til
you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie,
honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til
you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie,
honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til
you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie,
honey, honey, honey-pie
